      <h3>Synopsis</h3>

      <p>
        Write an application to manage your expense. These are the functionality
        you need to implement in your application:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          User should be able to create his/her personal expense. Expense record
          should include
          <code>id, title, category, description, amount, expenseDate</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          User should be able to update his/her expense by a given
          <code>id</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          User should be able to delete his/her expense by given
          <code>id</code>.
        </li>
        <li>User should be able to get all expenses.</li>
        <li>
          User should be able to search expense by <code>start date</code> and
          <code>end date</code> or only by <code>start date</code> (End date
          will be optional)
        </li>
        <li>
          User should be able to search expense by <code>category</code> with
          <code>start and end date</code> or only by <code>start date</code>.
          (End date will be optional)
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Note</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Category should be passed as a URL parameter in search functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start date and end date should be passed as query string in search
          functionality.
        </li>
        <li>Error handling should be done gracefully in your code.</li>
        <li>
          Follow TDD approach and write test cases before writing any
          functionality. All test case scenarios are written in index.spec.js
          file. Read all test cases instructions and write test cases for a
          functionality before writing code for that functionality.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Code structure &amp; Submission</h3>

      <p>
        You will have to submit in Hobbes for evaluation and feedback,
        submitting any number of times is fine, try to get 100% A seed code for
        this assignment is provided here,
        <a
          href="https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/stack_nodejs/expense_manager_app"
          >https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/stack_nodejs/expense_manager_app</a
        >
        without which you will struggle to submit in Hobbes Fork from this
        project but with a different name, try prefixing your forked project
        with your name and assignment number <em>Week01</em>
      </p>

      <h3>Objective</h3>

      <p>
        Should be able code using NodeJS and express, develop modules of own,
        allowed to use any external module only if necessary and significantly
        improve the code, create web service end point url, handle request,
        response cycle, parse and match Request URLs. Follow proper Language
        semantics, like naming variables, functions, files etc., Use modules to
        modularize the code Practice TDD by writing test cases using Mocha
        framework and Chai style of assertions Include necessary scripts in
        package.json for running test cases, to run lint checks Take care of
        adding modules as devDependency and dependency correctly Avoid using ES5
        language semantics, try as much as ES6
