## Assignments
Expense Manager App to show your daily expenses

## Deadline
Before next session

### Synopsis
Write an application to manage your expense. These are the functionality you need to implement in your application:
1. User should be able to create his/her personal expense. Expense record should include `id, title, category, description, amount, expenseDate`.
2. User should be able to update his/her expense by a given `id`.
3. User should be able to delete his/her expense by given `id`.
4. User should be able to get all expenses.
5. User should be able to search expense by `start date` and `end date` or only by `start date` (End date will be optional)
6. User should be able to search expense by `category` with `start and end date` or only by `start date`. (End date will be optional)

### Note
1. Category should be passed as a URL parameter in search functionality.
2. Start date and end date should be passed as query string in search functionality.
3. Error handling should be done gracefully in your code.
4. Follow TDD approach and write test cases before writing any functionality. All test case scenarios are written in index.spec.js file. Read all test cases instructions and write test cases for a functionality before writing code for that functionality.


### Code structure & Submission

- You will have to submit in Hobbes for evaluation and feedback, submitting any number of times is fine, try to get 100%
- A seed code for this assignment is provided here, https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/stack_nodejs/expense_manager_app without which you will struggle to submit in Hobbes
- Fork from this project but with a different name, try prefixing your forked project with your name and assignment number <YourName>_Week01_<whatever the rest you want to name it>

### Objective

- Should be able code using NodeJS and express, develop modules of own, allowed to use any external module only if necessary and significantly improve the code, create web service
- end point url, handle request, response cycle, parse and match Request URLs.
- Follow proper Language semantics, like naming variables, functions, files etc.,
- Use modules to modularize the code
- Practice TDD by writing test cases using Mocha framework and Chai style of assertions
- Include necessary scripts in package.json for running test cases, to run lint checks
- Take care of adding modules as devDependency and dependency correctly
- Avoid using ES5 language semantics, try as much as ES6

## MENTORS TO BEGIN REVIEW YOUR WORK ONLY AFTER 

- You add the respective Mentor as a Reporter/Master into your Assignment Repository
- You have checked your Assignment on the Automated Evaluation Tool - Hobbes (Check for necessary steps in your Boilerplate - README.md/PROBLEM.md file. ) and got the required score - Check with your mentor about the Score you must achieve before it is accepted for Manual Submission. 
- Intimate your Mentor on Slack and/or Send an Email to learner.support@stackroute.in - with your Git URL - Once you done working and is ready for final submission.
